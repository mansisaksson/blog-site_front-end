[-] Use multipart or JSON for sending files?
There are two main patterns for sending data between client and server, one if through Form Data,
which is quite old, and the other is to format it using something like JSON and then parse it on the server.
The problem with sending everything as JSON is that the size of serialized binary data is larger than if it were sent by
multipart form data, as form data has a special property form handling file transfer and is therefor quite efficiant at doing so.

The upside of using JSON is that I keep the code simple. Keeping all communication as JSON also gives a higher degree of flexibility
if I were to switch transfer protocol, or were to allow communication from a non browser source. (eg. a game or a login server).

CONCLUSION: Using multipart form data for this project does not make any sense. Better to commit to JSON.
